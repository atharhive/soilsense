## About  
SoilSense was built as a **hackathon pitch project** â€” a web platform designed to showcase an idea around soil health monitoring and data-driven insights for agriculture.  

At the moment, this repo exists as a **prototype** made for the hackathon.  
ðŸ‘‰ I currently donâ€™t have plans to continue development, but I might revisit it in the future.
